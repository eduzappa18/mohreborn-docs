## Events

ScriptThread -> Listener -> Class

### registerev

registerev( String eventname, String scriptname )

Registers script callback handler for given event type.
Example:

```
local.result = registerev "connected" global/eventhandlers.scr::connected
```

or

```
local.result = registerev("connected" global/eventhandlers.scr::connected)
```

Result:

```
When given even type will occur, EventSystem engine will execute given script.

local.result can have one of the following values:

0 = Registering event callback handler was successful
1 = Event callback handler is already registered for given event
2 = Memory allocation error
```

Please see Reborn Events System documentation for further information.

Example:

```
local.result = unregisterev "connected"
```

or

```
local.result = unregisterev("connected")
```

Result:

```
EventSystem engine will unregister events of given type and won't execute their script callback handlers.

local.result can have one of the following values:

0 = Unregistering event callback handler was successful
1 = Event callback handler is already unregistered
```

Please see Reborn Events System documentation for further information.

## Date/Time

stuffsrv "restart"
stuffsrv( "restart" )
```

or

```
stuffsrv "map dm/mohdm1"
stuffsrv( "map dm/mohdm1" )
```

Result:

```
Server will restart
```

or

```
Server will change map to dm/mohdm1
```

### traced

traced( Vector start, Vector end, [Integer pass_entities], [Vecotr mins], [Vector maxs], [Integer mask])

Performs a ray trace from start origin to end origin. It takes optional arguments such as entity number to be ignored/skipped by the trace, mins and maxs of trace box and trace mask.

Example:

```
local.trace = traced local.start local.end
```

or

```
local.trace = traced local.start local.end local.pass_entities local.mins
```

or

```
local.trace = traced local.start local.end local.pass_entities local.mins local.maxs local.mask
```

Result:

```
Array holding detailed information about trace:

local.trace["allSolid"] - <i>Integer</i> : it tells wheter trace was inside of a solid object
local.trace["startSolid"] - <i>Integer</i> : it tells wheter trace started in solid object
local.trace["fraction"] - <i>Float</i>
local.trace["endPos"] - <i>Vector</i> : position where trace finished because it may finish before it reaches end point specified by caller when it hits object with specified mask before it reaches end point
local.trace["surfaceFlags"] - <i>Integer</i>
local.trace["shaderNum"] - <i>Integer</i>
local.trace["contents"] - <i>Integer</i>
local.trace["entityNum"] - <i>Integer</i> : entity number that was hit
local.trace["location"] - <i>Integer</i>
local.trace["entity"] - <i>Entity</i> : entity that was hit by the trace
```
