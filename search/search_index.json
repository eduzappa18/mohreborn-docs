Every feature has also it's own dedicated page where it is described in detail. Admin accounts and permissions \u00b6 STABLE Traditionally, as a server administrator, you would manage your server via RCon (Remote Console) commands. Since RCon access is protected with a single password, getting help in moderating your server meant that you had to give away this password to other people and give them full control over the server. Reborn patch let's you create individual admin accounts with selected privileges. This way you can safely involve other people in server administration when you are away from your PC and give them specific privileges based on the level of trust you have for them. Banning and kicking players \u00b6 STABLE IP Banning \u00b6 Now you can ban player's IPs with simple command. It allows you to use wildcards to ban IP ranges. No more need of external applications for kicking people. This is a true (not emulated by auto-kicking) ban functionality that forbids player from connecting to the server. Name Banning \u00b6 This feature lets you ban impolite names from being used on your server or any occurrence of bad words in players names. Extended player kicking \u00b6 Reborn patch extends standard capabilities of kicking players out from the server with few new commands that add even more options to your admin tools arsenal. Chat management \u00b6 STABLE You can use it to punish people who use too many impolite, rude words and abuse your server this way. It is also possible to disable game chat entirely or for selected players. Protected player names \u00b6 STABLE With this feature you can protect player names with passwords. Only player who knows the password will be able to use protected name on your server. It's very useful if you want to protect names of your clan mambers or server admins and make sure no one else but them will be able to use them. This protects you against others spoofing server admins, clan members and against name stealing hacks which automatically change name of a cheater to someone elses name. When this kind of a cheat will try to steal player's protected name, cheater will get kicked. Anti Wallhack \u00b6 UNSTABLE The anti-wallhack is a blocker that works server side, it doesn't disable wallhacks on the client but it makes them almost useless. All the integrated blockers are working server side. A wallhack (cham skins, radar) works because the server usually sends all player position information to the client regardless if a player is visible or not. This is what wallhacks are using to render players behind walls. Now the anti-wallhack technology used in the patch checks for every client if a player is visible or not and sends only information about truly visible players to the client (information about player behind walls isn't send) - information that the client doesn't have can't be used to render players behind walls. This method can't be bypassed by clients and blocks successfully all kind of wallhacks, cham skins, etc. Anti NoRecoil \u00b6 UNSTABLE When player is using a NoRecoil cheat, his weapon doesn't kick up when he fires it. This system is responsible for detecting NoRecoil cheats and emulating recoil serverside so if player is using this cheat, he will get recoil/kick added to his weapon by the server and he can't do anything about this. Anti Shoot Through Walls Hack \u00b6 STABLE STWH stands for Shoot Through Walls Hack. Our system detects player who uses this cheat, and when he tries to shoot through a wall, it blocks his bullet, making the cheat useless. High Ping Autokick \u00b6 STABLE You can turn on autokick option for players with ping higher than a value you set. Connections Limiter \u00b6 STABLE You can set a max connections per IP limit. This way you can decide how many people from one IP can join your server. This can be used as an additional measure against fake player flood attacks. Anti Packet Flood \u00b6 STABLE Some cheaters might want to flood your server in order to remove your server from the list of online game servers, drop players from it or even perform a remote crash. To achieve this, they would perform a Denial of Service attack by flooding your server with malicious, spoofed getstatus and getinfo packets. MoH:AA server will have to handle millions of packet requests and will get busy trying to send responses instead of processing game play action. This feature will render such attacks useless by detecting IPs from which the attack comes and ignoring their requests. Stufftext Bypass Detection \u00b6 UNSTABLE stufftext is a server-side scripting command. It was created for scripters allowing them to change client settings in server-sided mods they write. Many mods make use of it. It can be used to force players to make screenshot (known as Forced SS), force them to turn off ForceModels or force their cvars to good values (this way some cheats could be turned off with server-sided mod). However client can bypass this stufftext command so it no longer works on his MoH:AA client. This way he would remain safe from any Admin Mods like Foresight, CI etc. This feature checks if player has this stufftext command bypassed, by using special technique and kicks player whenever it detects that he has it bypassed. Upgraded Voting System \u00b6 STABLE MoH:AA voting was never secure and almost never used. Thats why we have rewritten it. Now you can specify which commands players can use when voting and which maps they can vote for. When vote is casted, system will broadcast a graphical message to all players about current vote and other informations like: votes percentage, command that will be sent to server and after how much time the vote will expire. Automatic updates \u00b6 STABLE This will make updating patch a lot easier for developers and users. It automatically checks for new patch updates and installs them while server is running. You won't be bothered with restarting or closing the server to have up-to-date patch. Reborn Extended Scripting Engine \u00b6 STABLE We've managed to extend MoH:AA scripting engine with our own functionality that most of modders have never dreamt of. Reborn Extended Scripting Engine introduces 45 new script commands that can be used by modders to create even more powerful, content rich mods. Now they can: operate on files, date and time, create huddraw elements for individual players, communicate with server console, get extended information about each player and many more! We've also introduced Scripting EventSystem which allows modders to handle certain game events from their mods. Now they are able to interpret users keyboard input, handle players connection, disconnection, damage, kill events as well as map change, map restart events and more. Extras \u00b6 With Reborn patch server admins can perform even more actions, some of them are: disabling chat for all or only selected players disabling taunts for all or only selected players turning on simple team balancer kicking players with specifing reason of the kick sending private server messages to selected players These are only examples. You should read the rest of the documentation to learn about them all! Bug and Crash Fixes \u00b6 Medal of Honor Reborn patch comes with many fixes enabled by default: lod_spawn crash fix leave_team crash fix _fps skin crash fix dog, wuss, noclip, tele, give, fullheal, health, giveweapon - bad command fix say command buffer overflow crash fix userinfo buffer overflow crash fix remote crash fix (BufferOverflow - mohaabof & new one - infoboom) connect packet crash fix mohaa fill flood/crash fix (aka fake players fix) RCon flood protection getstatus/getinfo packet flood protection granade crash fix ladder crash fix swap team crash fix MG42 crouch fix landsharking fix shoot through Black Windows/Furniture/Light Bulbs fix","title":"Features Overview"},{"location":"features/features-overview/#features-overview","text":"Below you will find short overview of all features that come with Reborn 1.12 patch.

You can use it to bind certain events with your scripts, which will be executed when such events will take place. In short, EventSystem Engine allows scripters to have scripted events. Right now, EventSystem Engine supports 8 events: Scripter can write a script that will get executed by EventSystem Engine when one of them occurs. Such a script is called event callback handler and it have to be registered in the system before it can be used by it. To register event callback handlers, EventSystem Engine provides scripters with two commands: registerev - registers event callback handler unregisterev - unregisters event callback handler To see their full documentation please see Reborn Scripting Commands When scripter registers event callback handler it will get bound with certain event types listed earlier. EventSystem Engine will then execute his script (event callback handler) whenever events of given type will occur. Important EventSystem Engine allows only 1 to 1 binds, which means that you can't register one event type with more than one event callback handler. When scripter registers event callback handler, it won't be overwritten by next registerev commands, which means that EventSystem Engine will execute only those event callback handlers that where registered before any other callback handlers (in short: only firstly registered callback handlers). After map change, all events will be unregistered, so there's a need to register them again each map change, which shouldn't be a problem. Note Future EventSystem Engine may get improved or it's architecture may get changed a bit. Events \u00b6 Connected \u00b6 connected ( Entity entity ) Event that is generated when player has entered the server. Registering: local.result = registerev connected global/example.scr::connected or local.result = registerev connected global/connectedhandler.scr Callback handler: connected local.player: // your code here end or main local.player: // your code here end Where: local.player - player that has connected to server Disconnected \u00b6 disconnected ( Entity player ) Event that is generated when player has disconnected from the server.

Spawn \u00b6 spawn ( Entity player ) Event that is generated when player has spawned for the first time after entering the server, and each time he respawns. (It won't be generated for the first time when player is already spawned and map restart will occur. To force this event to be called after map restart, you have to move player to spectator before map restart.) Registering: local.result = registerev spawn global/example.scr::spawn or local.result = registerev spawn global/spawnhandler.scr Callback handler: spawn local.player: // your code here end or main local.player: // your code here end Where: local.player - player that has spawned or respawned.

You can use it to bind certain events with your scripts, which will be executed when such events will take place. In short, EventSystem Engine allows scripters to have scripted events. Right now, EventSystem Engine supports 8 events: Scripter can write a script that will get executed by EventSystem Engine when one of them occurs. Such a script is called event callback handler and it have to be registered in the system before it can be used by it. To register event callback handlers, EventSystem Engine provides scripters with two commands: registerev - registers event callback handler unregisterev - unregisters event callback handler To see their full documentation please see Reborn Scripting Commands When scripter registers event callback handler it will get bound with certain event types listed earlier. EventSystem Engine will then execute his script (event callback handler) whenever events of given type will occur. Important EventSystem Engine allows only 1 to 1 binds, which means that you can't register one event type with more than one event callback handler. When scripter registers event callback handler, it won't be overwritten by next registerev commands, which means that EventSystem Engine will execute only those event callback handlers that where registered before any other callback handlers (in short: only firstly registered callback handlers). After map change, all events will be unregistered, so there's a need to register them again each map change, which shouldn't be a problem.

For example, if we want to create new admin account with permissions to use commands: ad_restart ad_map ad_kick, ad_kickr, ad_clientkick, ad_clientkickr We take numeric values of permissions: ACCESSLEVEL_RESTART: 4 ACCESSLEVEL_MAPCHANGE: 2 ACCESSLEVEL_KICK: 32 and add them toghether: 4 + 2 + 32 = 38 Then we create new entry in admins.ini file: login=chris123 password=mySuperSecretPassw0rd! rights=38 Managing server using admin account \u00b6 Logging-in \u00b6 Connect to the server with your game client, by joining to the game as regular player. Then open your game console (use tilde '~' on your keyboard) and type the following command: ad_login <login> <password> for example: ad_login chris123 mySuperSecretPassw0rd! Based on validity of provided credentials, you will receive one of two possible messages: \"Admin System> You have been authed as admin\" \"USAGE: ad_login - wrong login or password. Please try again.\" Once you've successfully authenticated yourself, you will remain logged-in until you disconnect from the server. Issuing commands \u00b6 Once you have successfully logged-in to your admin account, you can start issuing commands. All server admin commands start with ad_ prefix. Open your game console during gameplay and simply type a command, for example: ad_status . You will see result of executing the command in your console. If you are not logged-in to your admin account or don't have enough permissions, you will receive appropriate information. Server audit \u00b6 Sometimes you want to make an audit and investigate who issued what commands and from which admin account.

However, server-side recoil emulation adds significant server load and detection is still not perfect and can cause false-positives, meaning that some players will be falsely marked as cheaters and will have server-side recoil added on top of the one their game client already adds.

You may want to turn it off, when server administration applications (CI, Foresight, Scapp etc.) are running, because the Anti Packet Flood System may block them. If you use tools that work by sending commands to your server via RCon protocol, it's recommended to use sv_remotetoolip cvar.

Anti Packet Flood comes with two additional cvars that help to fine tune the behavior: sv_packetflooddelay sv_packetfiltertime sv_packetflooddelay \u00b6 sv_packetflooddelay cvar is used to set the allowed time delay between two incoming packets from the same IP address. When delay between two packets is lower than this cvars value, they will be flagged as flood and dropped by the patch before they reach the engine. The value is in milliseconds and you can set it as follows: sv_packetflooddelay <0-65000> By default, it's set to 50 milliseconds. You shouldn't set the value higher than 500ms, because this may block packets of legit connected players, and you may have problems with your server not showing on game server browsers or have server administration applications (like CI, Foresight, Scapp etc.) kick random players from server. sv_packetfiltertime \u00b6 sv_packetfiltertime cvar is used as throttle time window. When Anti Packet Flood System detects, that 5 continuously incoming packets arrived to the server faster than packet time delay configured by sv_packetflooddelay cvar, it will turn on time throttle window. From this point on, it will drop all incoming packets for specified amount of milliseconds. You can set the throttle window in milliseconds as follows: set sv_packetfiltertime <0-65000> By default it's set to 2000 (ms).

Filtered words are stored in chatfilter.cfg file that can be edited by hand with text editor. Each word should be added in a new line. Line comments are supported, and work by adding double slashes in front of the line that should be commented out. Below is an example of chatfilter.cfg file: piss piss off pissoff // comment shit wank bollocks rush B Note Only basic words are supported in current version, so wildcards do not work. You will need to add the different versions of words you wish to block as new entries. If a player uses a filtered word, they will be sent a message in game to warn them. The message is blocked and not displayed on the screen. Users are given (by default) 3 chances before being kicked from the server for using bad words. g_badchatlimit cvar \u00b6 The default limit of warnings that player can receive before being kicked is configurable with g_badchatlimit cvar. Setting this cvar to high numbers is not recommended because it will make chat filters useless. Don't set g_badchatlimit to negative numbers, as this may lead to undefined patch behavior. When g_badchatlimit is set to 0, player that says a bad word will be kicked immediately, without any warning. chatfilteradd \u00b6 chatfilteradd command adds the given word to the list of chat filtered words. Usage: chatfilteradd <word> for example: chatfilteradd bollocks chatfilterremove \u00b6 chatfilterremove command removes the word from chat filtered words list. Players will be able to use that word again, without being punished. Usage: chatfilterremove <word> for example: chatfilterremove bollocks listchatfilter \u00b6 listchatfilter command lists all words that are filtered from the chat. It supports paging, which means that it splits all filtered words into smaller groups, which allows you to view them without scrolling inside game console. Usage: listchatfilter <page number #> for example: listchatfilter 3 There are 20 pages maximum, you can choose between page 1-20. Disabling chat \u00b6 It is possible to disable game chat entirely. This may be useful, when you do not have time and resources for proper chat administration, or when you simply prefer more focused gameplay, and you consider game chat to be a distraction. You may also wish to disable only voice taunts, which can be annoying when players spam them. You can disable chat globally with following cvars: sv_disablechat sv_disabletaunt or individually for selected players with following commands: dischat distaunt sv_disablechat cvar \u00b6 When this cvar is set to 1, server's chat will be disabled and players won't be able to send messages at all. This includes global/public chat, team chat, and private chat. In-game messages about kills and deaths will still be visible. sv_disabletaunt cvar \u00b6 This cvar disables taunts for all players on a server, when set to 1. You can disable it by setting it back to 0. dischat \u00b6 dischat command disables all chat abilities for player with given ID/game slot (clientnum). You can check player's clientnum with status command. If the command is used on player with chat already disabled, it will re-enable it. Usage: dischat <clientnum #> for example: dischat 5 distaunt \u00b6 distaunt command disables all taunt abilities for player with given ID/game slot (clientnum). You can check player's clientnum with status command. If the command is used on player with taunts already disabled, it will re-enable it them.

Steps Download latest Linux patch version from HERE and unzip it. Make a backup of your existing server . There are only a couple of files changed by the patch, but if you are not familiar with all the files and folders on your server, this can become confusing, so it's safer to backup everything. Shut down your MOHAA server via your host in the normal way. If your host has an auto restart feature, ensure your server does not restart after you have stopped it. Rename file fgameded.so to fgamededmohaa.so The file will be located in your MOHAA base folder ( for example /opt/MOHAA/ ). Base game folder location may differ depending on what host you are on. Some hosts may provide a HTTP file manager where you can rename the file or use FTP. Copy fgameded.so file that comes with the patch and paste it into your server's MOHAA base folder. Copy all of the rest of files that come with the patch and paste them into your server's MOHAA base folder. Hurray! You are done with installing the patch! It should run without crashing. If it crashes, or doesn't start at all, you probably made a mistake during installation process. Restore your back-up copy and repeat the installations steps, this time with more caution.

Rename file gamex86.dll to gamex86mohaa.dll The file will be located in your MOHAA main folder ( for example C:/MOHAA/main ). MoHAA main folder location may differ depending on what host you are on. Some hosts may provide a HTTP file manager where you can rename the file or use FTP. Copy gamex86.dll file that comes with the patch and paste it into your server's MoHAA /main/ folder. Copy all of the rest of files that come with the patch and paste them into your server's MoHAA /main/ folder. Hurray! You are done with installing the patch! It should run without crashing. If it crashes, or doesn't start at all, you probably made a mistake during installation process. Restore your back-up copy and repeat the installations steps, this time with more caution. Note It is important that you keep the original files and just rename them, otherwise the server will not work.","title":"Windows"},{"location":"getting-started/host-your-own-server/#docker","text":"You can run game server as Docker container.

GameSpy Industries, Inc. in http://www.poweredbygamespy.com/pricing/ It means that after May 31, 2014 - GameSpy masterserver, which kept list of all online MoH servers has been shut down. In-game browser stopped to work and players can't find new servers to play on anymore. xNULL team and community decided to create a replacement for default masterserver and created custom Reborn MasterServer that supports MoH:AA/SH/BT and GameSpy protocol in order to save the game we all love so much. Game Launcher \u00b6 The easiest way to play MoH:AA/SH/BT games is to download and install MoH Reborn Game Launcher. This is an open-source software created by us, to make player's lives easier. It will patch your game executables so that they will query Reborn MasterServer instead of original one to get list of all online servers and show them in the in-game server browser. Todo Game Launcher is not ready yet. You can help us develop it by contributing to: MoH Reborn Launcher Alternative solutions \u00b6 If you don't want to install and use Reborn Game Launcher (which we highly recommend), you can still make the in-game server browser work. This will however require a bit more technical knowledge. Manual executables replacement \u00b6 You can replace your game executables with the ones that are already patched. Simply download right bundle, unpack binaries and copy them to your game installation folder. When asked whether you want to overwrite original files, click \"Yes\". MAKE A BACKUP OF YOU ORIGINAL FILES BEFORE INSTALLING THE PATCHED ONES We provide patched binaries for both game clients and game servers.
